# Web Automation Framework with Selenium, Python, and GitHub Actions CI/CD

This project is a **web automation framework** using **Selenium** and **Python**, integrated with **GitHub Actions** for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**. The framework is designed for automating web application testing, with the tests executed automatically on each code push to the repository.

## Features

- **Web Automation:** Use Selenium and Python to automate web application testing.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automatically run tests with GitHub Actions on each push to the repository.
- **Test Reporting:** Generate test reports in HTML format, making it easy to view test results.
- **Easy Setup:** Minimal configuration required to get started.
  
## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the automation framework locally and on GitHub.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your local machine.
- **Google Chrome** and **ChromeDriver** (or any browser and corresponding driver of your choice).
- **GitHub Account** for pushing code and utilizing GitHub Actions CI/CD.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web_automation.git
   cd web_automation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Tests Locally

You can run the tests locally by using the following command:

```bash
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q --html=report.html
```

This will execute the tests and generate a `report.html` file that contains the test results.

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

This project is configured with **GitHub Actions** to automatically run the tests on each push to the `main` branch. The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. 

When you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:

1. Set up the Python environment.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the tests using `pytest`.
4. Upload the test results as an HTML report.

Check the **Actions tab** in your GitHub repository to view the workflow results.

### Test Results

Test results will be available in the **Actions tab** of the repository under the latest run. You can download the `pytest-report` artifact which contains the `report.html` for detailed test results.
